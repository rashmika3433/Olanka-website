			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p>In 2010, Olanka Travels took flight, piloted by Ravi, our CEO and Founder, with the main aim of becoming the best personalised travel agent in the world! This one-man show quickly gathered speed as the team at Olanka grew, fast and wide. Olanka Travels, spearheaded by Ravi, grew faster by attracting the right people around him. An integral part of our growth lies with listening to our customers valuable feedback and improving ourselves, where we compete with ourselves everyday!<br>At present, Olanka Travels is powered by a 200-strong workforce who all share the same belief - that personalised travel tours are the best way to experience a destination, and taking care of our customers needs by assisting them in every possible way is the most important part of our brand.<br>We believe in equality for all, and hence our team is now made up of 75% female staff! In addition, by creating countless opportunities for the younger generation, we contribute to empowering the youth who will take the company to its future.</p>
